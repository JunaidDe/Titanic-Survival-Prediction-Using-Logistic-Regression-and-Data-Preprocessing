# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression-and-Data-Preprocessing
This project focuses on predicting survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset was preprocessed, handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features. A Logistic Regression model was built, trained, and evaluated to predict passenger survival.
